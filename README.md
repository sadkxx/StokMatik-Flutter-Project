## 📁 Firebase Structure

The project uses a Firestore schema designed to support **multi-user environments**. Each authenticated user has their own isolated subcollections under the `users` collection. This ensures data separation — for example, Store A and Store B have their own set of customers, products, and sales history.

```
users (collection)
│
├── [user_id] (document)
│   ├── companyName
│   ├── companyType
│   ├── createdAt
│   ├── email
│   ├── emailVerified
│   ├── name
│   ├── surname
│   ├── tc
│   │
│   ├── customers (subcollection)
│   │   ├── name
│   │   ├── surname
│   │   ├── iletisim
│   │
│   ├── urunler (subcollection)
│   │   ├── urunadi
│   │   ├── barkod
│   │   ├── fiyat
│   │   ├── stok
│   │   ├── tur
│   │
│   └── satisRaporu (subcollection)
│       ├── urunAdi
│       ├── birimfiyat
│       ├── miktar
│       ├── toplamfiyat
│       ├── musteriAd
│       ├── musteriSoyad
│       ├── tarih
│       ├── tur
```

> 🧠 **Why this structure?**\
> This hierarchical model ensures that each store or market using the app has its own data sandbox, completely separated from other users. That means one market's customers, products, and reports won’t interfere with another’s.
